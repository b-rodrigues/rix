## Introduction

Isolated environments are great to run pipelines in a safe and reproducible
manner. This vignette details how to build a reproducible analytical pipeline
using an environment built with Nix that contains the right version of R and
packages.


## An example of a reproducible analytical pipeline using Nix

Suppose that I used `{targets}` to build a pipeline for a project and that I did
so using a tailor-made Nix environment. Here is the call to `rix()` that I used
to build that environment:


```{r}
path_default_nix <- tempdir()

rix(r_ver = "4.2.2",
    r_pkgs = c("targets", "tarchetypes", "rmarkdown"),
    system_pkgs = NULL,
    git_pkgs = list(package_name = "housing",
                    repo_url = "https://github.com/rap4all/housing/",
                    branch_name = "fusen",
                    commit = "1c860959310b80e67c41f7bbdc3e84cef00df18e"),
    ide = "other",
    project_path = path_default_nix,
    overwrite = TRUE)

```

This call to `rix()` generates the following `default.nix` file:


```{r echo = F}
cat(readLines(paste0(path_default_nix, "/default.nix")), sep = "\n")
```

The environment that gets built from this `default.nix` file contains R version
4.2.2, the `{targets}` and `{tarchetypes}` packages, as well as the `{housing}`
packages, which is a package that I developing specifically for this project.
Because it is on Github, it gets installed using the `buildRPackage` function
from Nix. I can use this environment to work on my project, or to launch my
`{targets}` pipeline. [This Github
repository](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nix_targets_pipeline/tree/master)
contains the finalized project.

If you use `{targets}` you could execute the pipeline in the environment by
running in a terminal:

```
cd /absolute/path/to/housing/ && nix-shell default.nix --run "Rscript -e 'targets::tar_make()'"
```

If you wish to run the pipeline whenever you drop into the Nix shell, you could
add a *Shell-hook* to the generated `default.nix` file:

```
...
pkgs.mkShell {
  LOCALE_ARCHIVE = if pkgs.system == "x86_64-linux" then  "${pkgs.glibcLocales}/lib/locale/locale-archive" else "";
  LANG = "en_US.UTF-8";
  LC_ALL = "en_US.UTF-8";
  LC_TIME = "en_US.UTF-8";
  LC_MONETARY = "en_US.UTF-8";
  LC_PAPER = "en_US.UTF-8";
  LC_MEASUREMENT = "en_US.UTF-8";

  buildInputs = [  rpkgs  system_packages ];
    shellHook = '' Rscript -e "targets::tar_make()" '';
}
```

Now, each time you drop into the Nix shell for that project using `nix-shell`,
the pipeline gets automatically executed.
