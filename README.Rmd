# Rix: Reproducible Environments with Nix

## Introduction

`{rix}` is an R package that provides functions to help you setup reproducible
and isolated development environments that contain R and all the required
packages that you need for your project. This is achieved by using the Nix
package manager that you must install separately. The Nix package manager is
extremely powerful: with it, it is possible to work on totally reproducible
development environments, and even install old releases of R and R packages.
With Nix, it is essentially possible to replace `{renv}` and Docker combined. If
you need other tools or languages like Python or Julia, this can also be done
easily. Nix is available for Linux, macOS and Windows (via WSL2).

## The Nix package manager

Nix is a piece of software that can be installed on your computer (regardless of
OS) and can be used to install software like with any other package manager. If
you're familiar with the Ubuntu Linux distribution, you likely have used
`apt-get` to install software. On macOS, you may have used `homebrew` for
similar purposes. Nix functions in a similar way, but has many advantages over
classic package managers. The main advantage of Nix, at least for our purposes,
is that its repository of software is huge. As of writing, it contains more than
80'000 packages, and the entirety of CRAN is available through Nix's
repositories. This means that using Nix, it is possible to install not only R,
but also all the packages required for your project. The obvious question is why
use Nix instead of simply installing R and R packages as usual. The answer is
that Nix makes sure to install every dependency of any package, up to required
system libraries. For example, the `{xlsx}` package requires the Java
programming language to be installed on your computer to successfully install.
This can be difficult to achieve, and `{xlsx}` bullied many R developers
throughout the years (especially those using a Linux distribution, `sudo R CMD
javareconf` still plagues my nightmares). But with Nix, it suffices to declare
that we want the `{xlsx}` package for our project, and Nix figures out
automatically that Java is required and installs and configures it. It all just
happens without any required intervention from the user. The second advantage of
Nix is that it is possible to *pin* a certain *revision* for our project.
Pinning a revision ensures that every package that Nix installs will always be
at exactly the same versions, regardless of when in the future the packages get
installed.

## Rix workflow

The idea of `{rix}` is for you to declare the environment you need, using the
provided `rix()` function, which in turn generates the required file for Nix to
actually generate that environment. You can then use this environment to either
work interactively, or run R scripts. It is possible to have as many
environments as projects. Each environment is isolated (or not, it's up to you).

The main function of `{rix}` is called `rix()`. `rix()` has several arguments:

- the R version you need for your project
- a list of R packages that your project needs
- an optional list of additional software (for example, a Python interpreter, or Quarto)
- an optional list with packages to install from Github
- whether you want to use RStudio as an IDE for your project (or VS Code, or another environment)
- a path to save a file called `default.nix`.

For example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rix(r_ver = "current", r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "chronicler"), ide = "rstudio")
```

The call above writes a `default.nix` file in the current working directory. This
`default.nix` can in turn be used by Nix to build an environment containing
RStudio, the current (or latest) version of R, and the latest versions of the
`{dplyr}` and `{chronicler}` packages. In th case of RStudio, it actually needs
to be installed for each environment. This is because RStudio changes some
default environment variables and a globally installed RStudio (the one you
install normally) would not recognize the R installed in the Nix environment.
This is not the case for other IDEs such as VS code or Emacs. Another example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rix(r_ver = "4.1.0", r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "chronicler"), ide = "code")
```

This call will generate a `default.nix` that installs R version 4.1.0, with the
`{dplyr}` and `{chronicler}` packages. Because the user wishes to use VS Code,
the `ide` argument was set to "code". This installs the required
`{languageserver}` package as well, but unlike `ide = "rstudio"` does not
install VS Code in that environment. Users should instead use the globally
installed VS Code.

It's also possible to install specific versions of packages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rix(r_ver = "current", r_pkgs = c("dplyr@1.0.0"), ide = "code")
```

but usually it is better to build an environment using the version of R that was
current at the time of the release of `{dplyr}` version 1.0.0, instead of using
the current version of R and install an old package.

### default.nix

The Nix package manager can be used to build reproducible development
environments according to the specifications found in a file called
`default.nix`, which contains an *expression*, in Nix jargon. To make it easier
for R programmers to use Nix, `{rix}` can be used to write this file for you.
`{rix}` does not require Nix to be installed, so you could generate expressions
and use them on other machines. To actually build an environment using a
`default.nix`, file, go to where you chose to write it (ideally in a new, empty
folder that will be the root folder of your project) and use the Nix package
manager to build the environment. Call the following function in a terminal:

```
nix-build
```

Once Nix done building the environment, you can start working on it interactively
by using the following command:

```
nix-shell
```

You will *drop* into a Nix shell. You can now call the IDE of your choice. For
RStudio, simply call:

```
rstudio
```

This will start RStudio. RStudio will use the version of R and library of
packages from that environment.

### Running programs from an environment

You could create a bash script that you put in the path to make this process
more streamlined. For example, if your project is called `housing`, you could
create this script and execute it to start your project:

```
!#/bin/bash
nix-shell /absolute/path/to/housing/default.nix --run rstudio
```

This will execute RStudio in the environment for the `housing` project. If you
use `{targets}` you could execute the pipeline in the environment by running:

```
cd /absolute/path/to/housing/ && nix-shell default.nix --run "Rscript -e 'targets::tar_make()'"
```

It's possible to execute the pipeline automatically using a so-called "shell
hook". See the "Non-interactive use" vignette for more details.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rix from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("b-rodrigues/rix")
```

Or you can install it from the
[{rix} r-universe](https://b-rodrigues.r-universe.dev/rix), which serves you 
from a CRAN-like R package repository:

```r
install.packages("rix", repos = c("https://b-rodrigues.r-universe.dev",
  "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

As stated above, `{rix}` does not require Nix to be installed to generate
`default.nix` files. But if you are on a machine on which R is not already
installed, and you want to start using `{rix}` to generate `default.nix` files,
you could first start by installing Nix, and then use the following command to
drop into a temporary Nix shell that comes with R and `{rix}` pre-installed:

```
nix-shell --expr "$(curl -sl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-rodrigues/rix/master/inst/extdata/default.nix)"
```

This should immediately build the nix environment and launch the nix-shell. You can now 
open the R console by hitting `R` and run something like this:

```
rix(r_ver = "current",
    r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "ggplot2"),
    other_pkgs = NULL,
    git_pkgs = NULL,
    ide = "rstudio",
    project_path = ".",
    overwrite = TRUE)
```

to generate a `default.nix`, and then use that file to generate an environment
with R, Rstudio, `{dplyr}` and `{ggplot2}`. If you need to add packages for your
project, rerun the command above, but add the needed packages to `r_pkgs`.

## Installing Nix

### Windows pre-requisites

If you are on Windows, you need the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) to run
Nix. If you are on a recent version of Windows 10 or 11, you can simply run this
as an administrator in PowerShell:

```
wsl --install
```

You can find further installation notes at [this official MS
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

We recommend to activate systemd in Ubuntu WSL2, mainly because this supports 
other users than `root` running Nix. To set this up, please do as outlined
[this official Ubuntu blog entry](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-wsl-enable-systemd):

```sh
# in WSL2 Ubuntu shell
sudo -i
nano /etc/wsl.conf
# add this entry
[boot]
systemd=true
# then restart running instance from PowerShell
wsl --shutdown
# relaunch Ubuntu WSL2
```

Afterwards, you can install Nix like business as usual. You can proceed with
the Determinant Systems installer. If you cannot or have decided not to activate
systemd, then you have to append `--init none` to the command. More details
about this you can find at 
[The Determinante Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer).

### Installing Nix using the Determinate Systems installer

To make installation and de-installation of Nix simple, we recommend the
Determinate Systems installer which you can find
[here](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install). This installer works for any
system and make [uninstalling Nix very easy as
well](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/uninstall).

### Docker

You can also try out Nix inside Docker. To do so, you can start your image from
the [NixOS Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nixos/nix/). NixOS is a full
GNU/Linux distribution that uses Nix as its system package manager.
