# Reproducible Environments with Nix

## Introduction

`{rix}` is an R package that leverages [Nix](https://nixos.org/),
a powerful package manager focusing on reproducible builds. With Nix, it is
possible to create project-specific environments that contain a project-specific
version of R and R packages (as well as other tools or languages, if needed).
You can use `{rix}` and Nix to replace `{renv}` and Docker with one single tool.
Nix is an incredibly useful piece of software for ensuring reproducibility of
projects, in research or otherwise. For example, it allows you run web 
applications like Shiny apps or `{plumber}` APIs in a controlled environment.

Nix has a fairly high entry cost though. Nix is a complex piece of software that
comes with its own programming language, which is also called Nix. Its purpose
is to solve a complex problem: defining instructions how to build software
packages and manage configurations in declarative way. This makes sure that 
software gets installed in fully reproducible manner, on any operating system or
hardware.

`{rix}` provides functions to help you write and deploy Nix expressions (written
in the Nix language). These expressions will be the inputs for the Nix package
manager, to build sets of software packages and provide them in a reproducible
development environment. These environments can be used for interactive data
analysis, or reproduced when running pipelines in CI/CD systems. On the 
[Nixpkgs collection](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs), there are currently more
than 80.000 pieces of software available through the Nix package manager. Using
{rix}, you can define and build isolated R environments through Nix package
manager with ease. Like this, environments contain R and all the required 
packages that you need for your project. You can also add any other software
tool available. The Nix R ecosystem currently includes the entirety of CRAN and
Bioconductor packages. Like with any other programming language and software, it
is also possible to install older releases of R packages, or install packages
from GitHub at defined states.

The Nix package manager is extremely powerful. Not only does it handle all the
dependencies their builds extremely well in deterministic manner. It is also 
possible with it to reproduce environments containing old releases of software.
It is thus possible to build environments containing R version 4.0.0 
(for example) to run an old project that was originally developed on that
version of R.

As stated above, with Nix, it is essentially possible to replace `{renv}` and
Docker combined. If you need other tools or languages like Python or Julia, this
can also be done easily. Nix is available for Linux, macOS and Windows (via
WSL2) and `{rix}` comes with the following features:

- install any version of R and R packages for specific projects;
- have several versions of R and R packages installed at the same time on the
  same system;
- define complete development environments as code and use them anywhere;
- run single R function (and objects in the call stack) in a different
  environment (potentially with a different R version and R packages) for an 
  interactive R session, and get back the output of that function using 
  `with_nix()`;
  
`{rix}` does not require Nix to be installed on your system to generate
expressions. This means that you can generate expressions on a system on which
you cannot easily install software, and then use these expressions on the cloud
or on a CI/CD environment to build the project there.

Here is an example of how to define an environment "as code" using `rix()`:

```{r, eval = F}
rix(r_ver = "latest",
    r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "ggplot2"),
    system_pkgs = NULL,
    git_pkgs = NULL,
    ide = "code",
    project_path = path_default_nix,
    overwrite = TRUE,
    print = TRUE)
```

This generates a file called `default.nix` in the path `path_default_nix` with
the correct expression to build this environment. To build the environment,
the Nix package manager must be installed.

## Quick start for returning users

*If you are not familiar with Nix or `{rix}` skip to the next section.*

If you are already familiar with Nix and R, and simply want to get started as
quickly as possible, you can start by installing Nix using the installer from
[Determinate
Systems](https://determinate.systems/posts/determinate-nix-installer) a company
that provides services and tools built on Nix:

```{sh, eval=FALSE}
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf \
    -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | \
     sh -s -- install
```

If you have R installed, you can start straight away from your R session by first
installing `{rix}`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rix", repos = c("https://b-rodrigues.r-universe.dev",
  "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

library("rix")
```

You can check that everything works well by trying to build the Nix expression
that ships with `{rix}`. Nix expressions are typically saved into files with the
name `default.nix` or `shell.nix`. This expression installs the latest version
of R and `{rix}` in a separate, reproducible environment:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
file.copy(
  # default.nix is the file containing the Nix expression
  from = system.file("extdata", "default.nix", package = "rix"),
  to = ".", overwrite = TRUE
)

# nix_build() is a wrapper around the command line tool `nix-build`
nix_build(project_path = ".")
```

If everything worked well, you should see a file called `result` next to
`default.nix`. You can now enter this newly built development environment by
opening a terminal in that folder and typing `nix-shell`. You should
be immediately dropped into an interactive R session.

If you don't have R installed, but have the Nix package manager installed, you
can run a temporary R session with R using this command (it will build the same
environment as the one above):

```
nix-shell --expr "$(curl -sl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-rodrigues/rix/master/inst/extdata/default.nix)"
```

You can then create new development environment definitions, build them, and
start using them.

## Getting started for new users

To get started with `{rix}` and Nix, you should read the following vignette
`vignette("a-getting-started")` 
([online documentation](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/rix/articles/a-getting-started.html)).
The vignettes are numbered to get you to learn
how to use `{rix}` and Nix smoothly. There’s a lot of info, so take your time
reading the vignettes. Don’t hesitate to open an issue if something is not
clear.

### Docker

You can also try out Nix inside Docker. To do so, you can start your image from
the [NixOS Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nixos/nix/). NixOS is a full
GNU/Linux distribution that uses Nix as its system package manager.

## Contributing

This package is developed using the `{fusen}` package. If you want to
contribute, please edit the `.Rmd` files found in the `dev/` folder. Then,
inflate the package using `fusen::inflate_all()`. If no errors are found
(warning and notes are OK), then commit and open a PR. To learn how to use
`{fusen}` (don't worry, it's super easy), refer to this
[vignette](https://thinkr-open.github.io/fusen/articles/How-to-use-fusen.html).
In our development workflow, we use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org)
via [{fledge}](https://fledge.cynkra.com).
